# Churn Prediction for Beta Bank: Maximizing Customer Retention with Data-Driven Insights

In the fast-paced and competitive world of banking, customer retention has emerged as a crucial factor for sustainable growth and success. **Beta Bank**, a prominent financial institution, has been facing a gradual exodus of customers, as they chip away little by little each month. **Recognizing the significance of preserving existing clients, Beta Bank has embarked on a mission to predict customer churn and implement strategic measures to retain valued customers**. This project aims to develop a robust churn prediction model using historical customer behavior data and contract termination records to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank soon.

## Project Goal

The project's primary goal is **to develop a churn prediction model with the maximum possible F1 score** to accurately predict whether a customer will leave Beta Bank soon. To pass the project, **the model needs to achieve an F1 score of at least 0.59 on the test set**, indicating a strong predictive performance in correctly identifying customers who are likely to churn. The secondary goal is to assess the model's performance using the AUC-ROC metric and compare it with the F1 score to gain comprehensive insights into the model's predictive capabilities.
